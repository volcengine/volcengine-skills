name: volcengine-sdk-generator
description: >
  Generate accurate Volcengine SDK examples by locating an API with the bundled local ranker,
  fetching its API Explorer swagger, and calling api/common/explorer/make-code with user-provided
  Params. Use when the user asks how to write Volcengine SDK code, generate SDK samples, or call a
  Volcengine API in Python, Go, Java, PHP, cURL, Node.js. Supports Chinese and
  English API names such as "角色扮演", "AssumeRole", or "STS AssumeRole". Also use for explicit SDK
  configuration questions about retry, timeout, AK/SK, STS, AssumeRole, temporary credentials,
  proxy, connection pooling, SSL, debug mode, request signing, response parsing, and error handling.
  If the user only needs API parameters, enum values, required fields, error codes, response
  schemas, pagination, or API comparisons, hand off to volcengine-api. If they need CLI-based
  operations, hand off to volcengine-cli.

# Volcengine SDK Generator

Generate ordinary Volcengine API call examples by default. Keep the default output focused on the
API call itself: authentication setup, request object/params, invocation, and printing the response.
Do not add retry, proxy, connection pool, debug logging, or other advanced SDK configuration unless
the user explicitly asks for those topics.

For advanced SDK configuration questions, use the language-specific files under `references/`.
These reference files are self-contained; answer from them directly.

| Topic | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| Go SDK configuration | `references/sdk-integration-go.md` |
| Python SDK configuration | `references/sdk-integration-python.md` |
| Java SDK configuration | `references/sdk-integration-java.md` |
| Node.js SDK configuration | `references/sdk-integration-nodejs.md` |
| PHP SDK configuration | `references/sdk-integration-php.md` |

## Core Rules

- API discovery uses `scripts/rg_rank.py`. After a concrete API is selected, call `scripts/make_code.py` in direct mode with `--service-code`, `--api-version`, and `--action`.
- `rg_rank.py` searches the bundled local ranker by default. It uses one `rg` recall pass when `rg` is installed and automatically falls back to pure Python scanning when `rg` is unavailable.
- If local ranking has zero results, `rg_rank.py` automatically falls back to the API Explorer search endpoint and marks those results as `remote_search`. Use `--remote-search` sparingly only when local results are clearly wrong or incomplete.
- Use the user's original request as the default `--query`; do not rewrite it into a guessed API name or SDK method. The ranker tolerates surrounding noise through keyword inference, alias matching, OR recall, and field-weighted scoring.
- Extract a shorter `--query` only when the user clearly self-corrects with words such as `等等`, `不对`, `重新来`, `我改主意`, `其实想要`, `其实是想要`, `应该是`, or `改成`; the extracted query must be a continuous substring from the user request, not a guessed API name.
- When multiple resources or services appear without a clear self-correction, run `rg_rank.py` once with the original request. If top candidates are across different services and top1 does not lead top2 by at least 30%, list concise candidates and ask the user to choose.
- Use `--resource`, `--intent`, `--service`, `--action`, and `--extra` only as high-confidence overrides or supplements when local ranking is noisy, the product alias is rare, or the user provides an explicit machine term. Values must come from the user wording or a trusted alias; do not invent terms. Manually provided `--resource`, `--intent`, and `--service` replace built-in inference for that group, so partial values can reduce recall. Include all known Chinese, English, and camelCase variants together when using them.
- Pure-generic queries such as `api`, `sdk`, or `demo` skip local matching by themselves and either trigger remote search or return `empty_query` when remote fallback is disabled. Refine the query with a concrete resource or action word.
- ServiceCode is case-sensitive. Preserve the exact `service_code` value from the selected API record when calling `make_code.py`; for example, `Kafka` is not `kafka`.
- When local ranking returns the same `service_code + action` across multiple API versions and the user did not specify a version, prefer the packaged API Explorer default version.
- Fetch `api-swagger` only after a concrete API is selected.
- The `api-swagger` fetch may include both `Version` and `APIVersion` because that endpoint expects them; the `make-code` payload must not include `Version`.
- Call `make-code` with `ApiAction`, `ServiceCode`, `APIVersion`, `Region`, and `Params`.
- Do not send `Version` to `make-code`.
- `Params` must come from the user. Do not auto-fill from swagger demos.
- Swagger is used for API metadata, required parameter hints, and lightweight validation. Do not serialize query arrays, form arrays, or `.N` parameters for `make-code`; pass the user’s JSON object as `Params`.
- If the user omits required top-level parameters, mock only those top-level required parameters and clearly mark them as mock values. Do not mock optional parameters. If a required top-level parameter is an object or array, recursively fill only required child fields/items.
- Mock values must be derived from the fetched swagger first: prefer `example`, then `examples`, then `default`, then `enum`, then type/constraint-aware fallback. If a swagger example is masked, such as `****` or `XX`, skip it and use a valid fallback value.
- Mock comments must be in Chinese by default and placed near the mocked assignment line when the target language supports line comments; do not add a duplicate mock banner at the top of the returned code.
- Returned SDK code must print the API response value. The script post-processes fixed `make-code` templates for Python, Go, Java, and PHP to assign the response and print it.
- Return the code generated by `scripts/make_code.py` as the primary SDK example. Do not rewrite SDK request construction, authentication setup, or response handling into a custom application unless the user explicitly asks for that. If optional formatting or convenience logic is added, keep the generated active response print, such as `print(resp)`, `fmt.Println(resp)`, `System.out.println(resp)`, `print_r($response)`, or `console.log(response)`.
- If language is not specified, return all languages from `DemoSdk`.
- SDK install/dependency info is a separate, on-demand capability. Only when the user explicitly asks how to install the SDK or which package/version to use (keywords such as 依赖, 安装, install, 版本, 包, maven, `go get`, pip, composer, npm), run `scripts/sdk_info.py` with `--service-code` and `--api-version` (reuse the selected API's values; add `--language` to filter to one of go/python/java/php/nodejs). It returns the live install command (`RunCommand`) plus package and version per language. Do NOT run it during normal code generation.
- If the API match is ambiguous, show concise candidates and ask the user to choose one. Do not add follow-up execution boilerplate such as saying that you will fetch swagger, mock required params, and call `make-code` after the user chooses.

## Workflow

1. Parse the user request:
   - API hint: action, Chinese name, service code, or natural-language description.
   - Language: Python, Go, Java, PHP, cURL, Node.js, or unspecified.
   - Params: JSON object supplied by the user.
   - Region: user value or default `cn-beijing`.

2. Locate or validate the API once for every request. If the user already provides `service_code`, `api_version`, and `action`, use those values as strict filters and verify they exist locally before direct mode. For natural-language requests, call `scripts/rg_rank.py` with `--query` first. Use the full original request unless a clear self-correction keyword points to a later target; in that case use the final target substring. Avoid optional term flags on the first pass. Manually provided `--resource`, `--intent`, and `--service` replace built-in inference for that group rather than merging with it, so a partial flag value can reduce recall. If you must use them, include all known variants together. If `rg_rank.py` returns `remote_search` results because the local ranker had zero hits, treat them as candidates and still verify the selected `service_code`, `api_version`, and `action` before calling direct mode. Avoid `--remote-search` unless the local candidates are obviously wrong or incomplete.

3. After selecting `service_code`, `api_version`, and `action`, call `scripts/make_code.py` in direct API mode with `--service-code`, `--api-version`, and `--action`. If top-level required params are missing, the script fills only those required top-level params with swagger-derived mock values and annotates the returned code in Chinese. Ask for clarification only when API selection is genuinely ambiguous after local ranking; in that clarification, only list candidates and ask the user to choose.

4. Once params are available, call `make-code` through the script and return the official code. Do not transform the generated sample into a hand-written utility; any custom formatting must be secondary and must preserve the active response print.

## Commands

Rank local candidates:

```bash
python3 scripts/rg_rank.py \
  --query '角色扮演' \
  --limit 10 \
  --format text
```

Use optional term flags only for high-confidence overrides or supplements, and keep `--query` as the user's wording:

```bash
python3 scripts/rg_rank.py \
  --query '标准型加速器替换公网带宽包' \
  --service 'ga' \
  --resource '公网带宽包|PublicBandwidthPackage' \
  --intent '替换|Replace' \
  --limit 10 \
  --format text
```

Direct API mode:

In TRN examples, `<account-id>` is the Volcengine account ID segment, such as a masked `2134xxxyyy`.

```bash
python3 scripts/make_code.py \
  --service-code sts \
  --api-version 2018-01-01 \
  --action AssumeRole \
  --language python \
  --params-json '{"DurationSeconds":3600,"RoleSessionName":"demo","RoleTrn":"trn:iam::<account-id>:role/demo"}'
```

Use `--refresh-swagger` when API Explorer metadata has just changed or generated code looks stale:

```bash
python3 scripts/make_code.py \
  --service-code sts \
  --api-version 2018-01-01 \
  --action AssumeRole \
  --refresh-swagger \
  --params-json '{}'
```

Fetch SDK install/dependency info on demand (only when the user asks about install, package, or version):

```bash
python3 scripts/sdk_info.py \
  --service-code sts \
  --api-version 2018-01-01 \
  --language go
```
